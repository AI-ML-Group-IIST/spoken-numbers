# spoken-numbers
Python/tensorflow code to get number spoken (based on spoken-number dataset)

The data.zip file contains all the data (voice files ~2000 files split into test and train). The program has comments explaining each step. The path assumes that the data is in the folder named data and both the program and the folder data are in the same parent folder.
